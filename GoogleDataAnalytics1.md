# Course 1: Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere
## Module 2:
### Data Life Cycle
- **Plan**: Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it.
- **Capture**: Collect or bring the data from a variety of different sources.
- **Manage**: Care for or maintain the data. How and where it is stored or the tools to do so.
- **Analyze**: use the data to solve the problems, make decisions and support business goals.
- **Archive**: Keep relavant data stored for long-term and future references.
- **Destroy**: Delete data from the storage and any shared copy of it.
### Phases of Data analysis
- **Act**: Undertanding the questions. Analysts need to know what the stakeholders want to achieve and figure out the questions to be answered.
- **Prepare**: Focusing on identifying, gathering the right data from approriate sources. Analysts also learn about different data types and the importance of using objective and unbiased information.
- **Process**: Focusing on cleaning and preparing the data (handling errors, transforming data formats, combining dataset, addressing outliers)
- **Analyze**: Using techniques. tools (Spreadsheets, SQL, R) to analyze the prepared data and extract insights.
- **Share**: Communicating to help stakeholders understand the results using visualizations or storytelling techniques.
- **Act**: Putting insights into actions (creating reports, making recommendations, implementing changes)
> While the data analysis process will drive your projects and help you reach your business goals, you must understand the life cycle of your data in order to use that process. To analyze your data well, you need to have a thorough understanding of it. Similarly, you can collect all the data you want, but the data is only useful to you if you have a plan for analyzing it.

> The Plan and Ask phases both involve planning and asking questions, but they tackle different subjects. The Ask phase in the data analysis process focuses on big-picture strategic thinking about business goals. However, the Plan phase focuses on the fundamentals of the project, such as what data you have access to, what data you need, and where youâ€™re going to get it.
### Data analysis toolbox
- **Spreadsheets (Excel, GG Sheets)**: Foundations for organizing, sorting, storing, performing calculations on data (fomulas, functions). They help identify patterns in the data or even create visualizations.
- **SQL**: A tool that helps interact with databases. It is effective for handling large and complex datasets. SQL allows analysts to select, create, add or get data from a database.
- **Data Visualization tools (Tableau, Looker)**:  Tools to transform data analysis results into visual representations (charts, graphs,..) for better understanding the insights.

## Module 3:
### Spreadsheet basics
- **Fomulas**: Fomulas start with an equal sign (=) and act like calculators that let us perform calculations. Fomulas are created by users.
- **Functions**: Functions are simply built-in fomulas of the spreadsheets.

### SQL and Data visualization
- **SQL**: SQL is a programming language that allows analysts to communicate with databases, enabling data retrieval and manipulation. *SELECT*, *FROM*, *WHERE* are essential clauses of SQL.
- **Data Visualization**: Data visualization makes data easier to understand and more engaging for the audience. Some tools for visualizing data include: Spreadsheet, Tableau, R
### Terms and Definitions
- **Attribute**: A characteristic or quality of data used to label a column in a table
- **Observation**: The attributes that describe a piece of data contained in a row of a table

## Module 4:
###  Data in Business
- Businesses use data analytics to explore issues, answer questions, and solve problems.
- Data-driven decision-making, using facts discovered through data analysis, is crucial for effective business strategy.
- Data analysis provides a complete picture of a problem, going beyond observation and intuition. It allows for informed decision-making and discovery of new solutions.
### Fairness in Data analytics
- **Fairness** in data analysis means making sure the analysis does not create or reinforce bias, leading to fair and inclusive systems.
- Conclusions drawn from data might be technically true, but they can be unfair if the full context and biases in the data are not considered.
### How to Ensure Fairness:
- **Consider all data available**: Analyze all the relevant data, including information that does not fit the expectations, for accurate insights.
- **Identify surrounding factors**: Understand all the context surrounding the data.
- **Include Self-reporting data**: Minimize observer's bias by collecting information provided by individuals.
- **Use oversampling effectively**: *Oversampling* is the process of increasing the sample size of nondominant groups in a population. Oversampling ensures that less represented groups are proportionally included, leading to more inclusive analysis.
- **Think about fairness from beginning to end:** consider fairness from the earliest stages of a project 
### Terms and Definitions
- **Business task**: The question or problem data analysis resolves for a business
- **Oversampling**: The process of increasing the sample size of nondominant groups in a population.

### Potential Bias in Data
- Everyone brings their own experiences and biases, potentially leading to different interpretations of the same data.
- Conscious and subconscious biases, influenced by cultural, social, and market norms, can impact data analysis.
