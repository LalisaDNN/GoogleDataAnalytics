# Course 2: Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions
----
## Module 1
Data analysts are constantly asking questions in order to find solutions and identify business potential. In this part of the course, youâ€™ll learn about effective questioning techniques that will help guide your analysis.
### Problem-solving and effective questioning
The six data analysis phases:
1. **Ask:**
> -  Define the problem
> - Understand the expectations
> - Focus on the problem, avoid distractions
> - Collaborate and communicate with stakeholders
> - See the whole context
2. **Prepare**: Decide what data to collect in order to answer the questions and how to oragnize it.
> - What metrics to measure
> - Locate data in the DB
> - Create security measures to protect data
3. **Process**: Clean data to get rid of errors, inaccuracies, inconsistencies.
> - Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data
> - Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces
> - Removing repeated entries
> - Checking for bias in data
4. **Analyze**: Think analytically about the data.
> - Perform calculations
> - Combine data from multiple sources
> - Create tables with the results
> - What the story is the data telling?
> - How will data help solve the problem?
5. **Share**: Using tools to create visualization/summarization for the data
> - Make better and more informed decisions
> - Communication the findings
6. **Act**: 
> - Recognize current problem or situation
> - Organize available information
> - Reveal gaps and opportunities
> - Identify the opinions
### Common problem types with data
1. **Making predictions**: Using data to make predictions about the future.
2. **Categorizing things**: Organizing information into different groups based on shared traits.
3. **Spotting something unusual**: Identifying data that deviates from the norm.
4. **Identifying themes**: Grouping categorized informations into broader concepts.
5. **Discovering connections**: Finding shared challenges among different groups.
6. **Finding patterns**: Using historical data to identify recurring trends.
### Ask effective questions
Using the SMART framework: Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, Time-bound.
- **Specific**: The question should be focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas. Avoid being overly broad or general.
- **Measurable**: Frame your question in a way that allows for quantification and assessment.
- **Action-oriented**: The goal is to formulate questions that encourage change and problem-solving.
- **Relevant**: Ensure your questions directly relate to the problem you're trying to solve. Each question should move you closer to a solution.
- **Time-bound**: Define a specific time frame for your question. This helps narrow down the scope and focus on the most relevant data. 
### Avoid asking these questions:
- **Leading questions**: questions that only have a particular response.
- **Closed-ended questions**: questions that ask for a one-word or brief response only.
- **Vague questions**: questions that aren't specific or don't provide context.
### Common topics for asking questions
- Objectives
- Audience
- Time
- Resources
- Security

### The power of data
- **Data-driven decisions:** use facts and figures to guide strategy, *relying heavily* on the available data's quality and quantity. While very effective with sufficient data, this approach can be *limited by biases or an overreliance on historical data*. 
- **Data-inspired decisions:** incorporate data analysis but also consider a wider context, including qualitative insights, feelings, experiences, and other less measurable factors.
### Types of data
- **Quantitative data**: Quantitative data deals with *measurable numerical facts*, answering "what," "how many," and "how often" questions. Think of it as the hard numbers behind a trend, collected through tools like surveys and polls.
- **Qualitative data**: Qualitative data dives into the "why" behind the numbers, exploring *qualities, characteristics, and opinions* that can't be easily quantified. It can be gathered through methods such as focus groups and interviews.
### Data visualization tools
- **Reports**: Reports present static data, offering a historical snapshot, often used for information delivered periodically.
> Pros:
> - High-level historical data
> - Easy to design 
> - Pre-cleaned and sorted data

> Cons:
> - Continual maintenance
> - Less visually appealing
> - Static
- **Dashboards**: Dashboards monitor live data, providing a dynamic view and allowing for interactive exploration through filters, making them suitable for tracking real-time trends.
> Pros:
> - Dynamic, automatic and interactive
> - More stakeholder access
> - Low maintenance

> Cons:
> - Labor-intensive design
> - Can be confusing
> - Potentially uncleaned data

### Metrics
- A metric is a quantifiable measurement used to track a specific data point, like revenue per salesperson. (ROI - Return on Investment, Customer retention rate, etc)
- **Metric goal**: A measurable goal set by a company and evaluated using metrics.

### Connect the data
- **Mathematical thinking**: The ability to break down problems logically to uncover patterns within data. This helps determine the best analysis tools by enabling a clear understanding of the problem's components.

|**Small Data**|**Big Data**|
|--------|---------|
|Describes a dataset made up of specific metrics over a short, well-defined time period|Describes large, less-specific datasets that cover a long time period|
|Usually organized and analyzed in spreadsheets|Usually kept in a database and queried|
|Likely to be used by small and midsize businesses|Likely to be used by large organizations|
|Simple to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent|Takes a lot of effort to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent|
|Usually already a manageable size for analysis|Usually needs to be broken into smaller pieces in order to be organized and analyzed effectively for decision-making|
- ***Four V's of Big Data**: 
    - **Volume**: The amount of data
    - **Variety**: The different kinds of data
    - **Velocity**: How fast the data can be processed
    - **Veracity**: The quality and reliability of the data
