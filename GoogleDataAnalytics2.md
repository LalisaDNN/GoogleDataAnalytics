# Course 2: Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions
----
## Module 1
Data analysts are constantly asking questions in order to find solutions and identify business potential. In this part of the course, youâ€™ll learn about effective questioning techniques that will help guide your analysis.
### Problem-solving and effective questioning
The six data analysis phases:
1. **Ask:**
> -  Define the problem
> - Understand the expectations
> - Focus on the problem, avoid distractions
> - Collaborate and communicate with stakeholders
> - See the whole context
2. **Prepare**: Decide what data to collect in order to answer the questions and how to oragnize it.
> - What metrics to measure
> - Locate data in the DB
> - Create security measures to protect data
3. **Process**: Clean data to get rid of errors, inaccuracies, inconsistencies.
> - Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data
> - Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces
> - Removing repeated entries
> - Checking for bias in data
4. **Analyze**: Think analytically about the data.
> - Perform calculations
> - Combine data from multiple sources
> - Create tables with the results
> - What the story is the data telling?
> - How will data help solve the problem?
5. **Share**: Using tools to create visualization/summarization for the data
> - Make better and more informed decisions
> - Communication the findings
6. **Act**: 
> - Recognize current problem or situation
> - Organize available information
> - Reveal gaps and opportunities
> - Identify the opinions
### Common problem types with data
1. **Making predictions**: Using data to make predictions about the future.
2. **Categorizing things**: Organizing information into different groups based on shared traits.
3. **Spotting something unusual**: Identifying data that deviates from the norm.
4. **Identifying themes**: Grouping categorized informations into broader concepts.
5. **Discovering connections**: Finding shared challenges among different groups.
6. **Finding patterns**: Using historical data to identify recurring trends.
### Ask effective questions
Using the SMART framework: Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, Time-bound.
- **Specific**: The question should be focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas. Avoid being overly broad or general.
- **Measurable**: Frame your question in a way that allows for quantification and assessment.
- **Action-oriented**: The goal is to formulate questions that encourage change and problem-solving.
- **Relevant**: Ensure your questions directly relate to the problem you're trying to solve. Each question should move you closer to a solution.
- **Time-bound**: Define a specific time frame for your question. This helps narrow down the scope and focus on the most relevant data. 
### Avoid asking these questions:
- **Leading questions**: questions that only have a particular response.
- **Closed-ended questions**: questions that ask for a one-word or brief response only.
- **Vague questions**: questions that aren't specific or don't provide context.
